<meta name="description" content="Pooja Suri, PhD Candidate in Health Economics at UC Berkeley.">

I have a PhD in Health Policy with a focus on economics from the University of California, Berkeley. My research applies microeconomic methods to address challenges in maternal and child health, as well as broader global health issues.

The focus of my ongoing work is understanding the dynamics of health decision-making within multigenerational households, where decisions are predominantly collective. I study the effect of social norms, intergenerational and spousal bargaining, and the targeting and delivery of information on health behaviors, particularly in the context of maternal and child health, and improving access to care.

I have worked on research projects in South Asia and Africa, and conducted fieldwork in multiple states in India and Uganda. Before attending graduate school, I was employed at the Stanford Center for Health Education and J-PAL South Asia.
