<p>A significant proportion of deaths and re-hospitalizations for both mothers and newborns occur in the first few weeks following birth. Family caregivers in India possess a large influence on the mothers’ decisions during their pregnancy and the postpartum period; evidence suggests that the stronger the quality of the relationship, the more likely the mother is to engage in WHO-recommended best practices. Nevertheless, the influence of different types of caregivers, especially grandparents, on health outcomes for both the mother and newborn remains poorly understood. This paper explores the dynamics within new mother and caregiver dyads, investigating the role of caregivers (primarily the father, maternal and paternal grandmother of the newborn) and their influence on postpartum care in four states in India. We find that, agreement within dyads is low. Birthing women themselves believe they don’t have agency, and are not likely to name themselves as primary caregivers for themselves and the infants. However, the reverse is true for caregivers.</p>

<p>We assess the impacts of a randomized school-based deworming intervention in Kenya on the mortality of recipients’ children using a 23-year longitudinal data set of over 6,500 original participants and their offspring. The under-5 mortality rate fell by 22% (17 deaths per 1000 live births) for children of treatment group individuals. We find that a combination of improved health, education and living standards, increased urban residence, delayed fertility, and greater use of health care in the parent generation contributed to the reduction. The results provide evidence for meaningful intergenerational benefits of child health investments.</p>

<p>Breastfeeding promotion is a national health priority in South Africa. Regular perinatal home visits by community health workers (CHWs) have helped promote exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in under resourced settings. Innovative, digital approaches including mobile video content have also shown promise, especially as access to mobile technology increases among CHWs. We conducted a stratified, cluster-randomized controlled trial from November 2018 to March 2020 in Khayelitsha, South Africa that measured the effects of an animated, mobile video series, the Philani MObile Video Intervention for Exclusive breastfeeding (MOVIE), delivered by a cadre of CHWs (“mentor mothers”). The trial was conducted in collaboration with the Philani Maternal Child Health and Nutrition Trust, a nongovernmental community health organization. We quantified the effect of the MOVIE intervention on EBF at 1 and 5 months (primary outcomes), and on other infant feeding practices and maternal knowledge (secondary outcomes). The videos replaced about two-fifths of CHWs’ direct engagement time with participants in the intervention arm. The similar outcomes in the 2 study arms thus suggest that the videos were as effective as face-to-face counselling, when CHWs used them to replace a portion of that counselling. Where CHWs are scarce, mHealth video interventions could be a feasible and practical solution, supporting the delivery and scaling of community health promotion services</p>
